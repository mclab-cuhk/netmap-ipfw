This is the modification on dummynet-over-netmap, to accept bandwidth limit profiles, variable over time.

The bandwidth profile data is supplied as pair-wise "START TIME, BANDWIDTH LIMIT" per row in the data file.

The time slots per bandwidth limit can be variable with a granularity of down to 0.2 ms.
